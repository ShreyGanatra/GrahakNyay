0,When was the Consumer Protection Act 2019 enacted? Is the Consumer Protection Act 1986 still valid?,"The Consumer Protection Act 2019 was notified on August 9, 2019. However, it came into effect on July 20, 2020. This Act replaced the Consumer Protection Act 1986 to address the contemporary issues faced by consumers and to streamline the consumer grievance redressal process in India. 

The Consumer Protection Act 1986 was the first significant legislation in India aimed at protecting consumer interests. It provided for the establishment of consumer councils and other authorities for the settlement of consumers' disputes and for matters connected therewith. It has now been repealed by the Consumer Protection Act 2019. Under Section 107(2) of the Consumer Protection Act 2019, all disputes arising out of the previous act shall now be governed by the new act.",General
1,What are the main features of the Consumer Protection Act 2019?,"The Consumer Protection Act 2019 retains several provisions from the older legislation but introduces numerous new measures to strengthen consumer rights and provide a comprehensive framework for consumer protection. Here are the main features of the Act:
Inclusion of E-commerce and Direct Selling Transactions: The Act now covers transactions conducted through e-commerce platforms and direct selling. This ensures that consumers engaging in online and direct sales are protected under the law.
Establishment of Central Consumer Protection Authority (CCPA): A key feature of the new Act is the establishment of the Central Consumer Protection Authority (CCPA). The CCPA has been empowered to regulate matters relating to the violation of consumer rights, unfair trade practices, and misleading advertisements. It can take suo-moto actions, recall products, and initiate class actions.
Strict Norms for Misleading Advertisements: The Act imposes strict regulations on misleading advertisements. It holds manufacturers, service providers, and endorsers accountable for false claims and deceptive marketing practices, thus protecting consumers from being misled.
Product Liability: The new Act introduces stringent norms for product liability, making manufacturers, sellers, and service providers responsible for any harm caused by defective products or deficient services. This ensures that consumers can seek compensation for any damage or injury.
Enhancement in Pecuniary Jurisdiction: The Act has increased the pecuniary jurisdiction of consumer courts. This means that the monetary limit for cases that can be handled by District, State, and National Commissions has been raised, allowing more significant claims to be addressed at each level.
Greater Ease in Dispute Resolution: The Act aims to simplify and expedite the dispute resolution process. It promotes the resolution of consumer disputes through mediation, offering an alternative to the traditional court process. This makes it easier and faster for consumers to settle their grievances.
Addition of Unfair Trade Practice Clauses: The Act has expanded the definition of unfair trade practices to include unfair contracts. This ensures that any terms in a contract that are biased against the consumer or are excessively one-sided can be challenged and declared null and void.
E-filing of Complaints: Consumers can now file complaints electronically, making the process more accessible and convenient. This is particularly beneficial for those who may not be able to physically visit consumer courts.
Mediation as an Alternate Dispute Resolution: The introduction of mediation as an alternate dispute resolution mechanism provides a more amicable and less adversarial way of resolving consumer disputes. This helps in reducing the burden on consumer courts and provides quicker resolutions.",General
2,"What Rights are guaranteed under Consumer Protection Act, 2019 for consumers?","The Consumer Protection Act of 2019 ensures several fundamental rights for consumers. These rights are crucial pillars in safeguarding consumer interests and ensuring fair treatment in the marketplace. Here are the six rights guaranteed under the Act:

1. Right to Safety: Consumers have the right to expect that the products and services they purchase are safe for use or consumption. This right ensures protection from hazardous or substandard goods.

2. **Right to be Informed**: Consumers have the right to receive accurate and transparent information about the products and services they intend to purchase. This includes details regarding quality, quantity, price, ingredients, and any associated risks.

3. **Right to Choose**: Consumers have the freedom to select from a range of products and services offered by various providers. This right promotes competition in the market and empowers consumers to make informed decisions based on their preferences.

4. **Right to be Heard**: Consumers have the right to express their grievances and concerns regarding unsatisfactory products or services. This includes the opportunity to voice complaints, provide feedback, and seek resolution through accessible channels.

5. **Right to Seek Redressal**: Consumers have the right to seek appropriate remedies and compensation for any harm or inconvenience caused by defective products or deficient services. This right ensures access to fair and efficient dispute resolution mechanisms.

6. **Right to Consumer Awareness**: Consumers have the right to access information and resources that enhance their understanding of their rights and responsibilities in the marketplace. This includes education on consumer protection laws, awareness campaigns, and access to relevant support services.

These rights collectively empower consumers to make informed choices, demand accountability from businesses, and seek recourse in cases of unfair treatment or exploitation. By upholding these rights, the Consumer Protection Act aims to foster trust and confidence in the marketplace while promoting a fair and competitive economic environment.",General
3,Who is a Consumer?,"Under the Consumer Protection Act 2019, a consumer is defined comprehensively to include individuals engaging in various types of transactions. Here's an expanded explanation:
Definition of a Consumer:
General Definition:
A person who buys any goods: This includes anyone who purchases goods for consideration (payment), whether the payment is made upfront, promised, partly paid, or deferred. The definition also extends to users who use the goods with the buyer's approval and beneficiaries of services.
Hires or avails any services: Similar to the purchase of goods, this includes individuals who hire or use services for consideration, whether the payment is made, promised, partly paid, or deferred.
Inclusion of Various Transaction Modes:
The Consumer Protection Act 2019 explicitly includes both offline and online transactions. This encompasses purchases made through electronic means such as websites and mobile apps, as well as teleshopping, direct selling, and multi-level marketing.
Personal Use Criterion:
To qualify as a consumer under the Act, the goods or services must be bought for personal use and not for commercial purposes like manufacturing or resale. This distinction ensures that the Act primarily protects individuals who are end-users of products and services, rather than businesses engaged in commercial activities.
Examples of a Consumer:
Individual Purchaser: Someone who buys a refrigerator for use in their home.
Service User: A person who subscribes to an internet service for personal use.
Online Shopper: An individual who purchases clothing from an e-commerce website.
Teleshopping Buyer: Someone who orders a fitness equipment via a teleshopping channel.
Direct Selling: A person who buys skincare products directly from a company representative.
Multi-Level Marketing: An individual purchasing wellness products through a multi-level marketing scheme for personal use.",General
4,Who is not a consumer?,"A consumer is defined as someone who buys goods or avails services for personal use and not for commercial purposes. However, certain categories of people are explicitly excluded from this definition. Here are the main exclusions:
A person who obtains goods free of charge: If an individual receives goods without any payment, they are not considered a consumer under the Act. This means they cannot seek remedies under consumer protection laws for issues related to those goods.
A person who avails services free of charge: If someone uses services without paying for them, they do not fall under the definition of a consumer. Consequently, they cannot file complaints or seek redressal for any grievances related to those services. However, if services are provided for free along with a product, you can argue that since you paid for the product, those services should be included in a product liability claim.
A person who obtains goods for resale or for any commercial purposes: Individuals or entities that purchase goods with the intention of reselling them or using them for commercial activities are not considered consumers. The Act aims to protect end-users, not those involved in commercial transactions.
A person who avails services for any commercial purposes: Those who use services for commercial purposes, such as in their business operations, are also excluded from the definition of a consumer. The protection offered by the Act is intended for personal, not business, use.
A person who avails services under a contract of service: Individuals who receive services as part of a contract of service, such as employees receiving services from their employers, are not considered consumers. These situations are typically governed by employment laws rather than consumer protection laws.
Clarification on commercial purposes: It is important to note that the Act specifies an exception to the exclusion for commercial purposes. If a person buys and uses goods exclusively for the purpose of earning their livelihood through self-employment, they are still considered a consumer. This means that small business owners, artisans, or individuals using goods for personal business activities to sustain their livelihood are protected under the Act.",General
5,What are goods?,"Goods refer to every kind of movable property. This definition encompasses all items that can be physically moved, regardless of their nature or purpose. Additionally, ""goods"" explicitly include ""food"" as defined in clause (j) of sub-section (1) of section 3 of the Food Safety and Standards Act, 2006. This means that all consumable items classified as food under this Act are also considered goods. However, immovable items such as property are not covered under goods",General
6,"What is deficiency under the Consumer Protection Act, 2019?","Deficiency under the Consumer Protection Act refers to any fault, imperfection, shortcoming, or inadequacy in the quality, nature, and manner of performance that a person is required to maintain by law or has undertaken to perform in relation to any service. This includes:
Negligence or Omission: Any act of negligence, omission, or commission by the service provider that causes loss or injury to the consumer.
Withholding Information: Deliberate withholding of relevant information by the service provider to the consumer.
Explanation: Whenever there is a deficiency in services, the customer is taken advantage of, leading to financial loss. Any form of negligence, omission, or wrongful act can result in harm to consumers.
Section 2(11) of the Consumer Protection Act, 2019: This section defines ""deficiency in service"" in a similar manner. It states that any fault, imperfection, shortcoming, or inadequacy in the quality, nature, and manner of performance that is required to be maintained by law or as per a contract is considered a deficiency. This includes any act of negligence, omission, commission, or deliberate withholding of relevant information by the service provider to the consumer.
Applicable Sectors: Deficiency of service can occur in any buyer-seller relationship and spans across various sectors including legal aid, banks, railways, construction, transportation, education, electricity, entertainment, restaurants, and hospitality.
In summary, a deficiency in service involves any failure to meet the required standards or contractual obligations, causing harm or loss to the consumer.",General
7,What is an unfair contract?,"An unfair contract refers to a contract between a manufacturer, trader, or service provider and a consumer that contains terms causing a significant change in the consumer's rights. These terms include:
a. Excessive Security Deposits: Requiring consumers to provide manifestly excessive security deposits for the performance of contractual obligations.
b. Disproportionate Penalties: Imposing penalties on consumers for breach of contract that are wholly disproportionate to the loss incurred by the other party.
c. Refusal of Early Repayment: Refusing to accept early repayment of debts even when the consumer is willing to pay the applicable penalty.
d. Unilateral Termination: Entitling one party to terminate the contract unilaterally without a reasonable cause.
e. Detrimental Assignment: Permitting one party to assign the contract to the detriment of the consumer without the consumer's consent.
f. Unreasonable Charges or Conditions: Imposing any unreasonable charge, obligation, or condition on the consumer that puts them at a disadvantage.
In summary, an unfair contract contains terms that significantly disadvantage the consumer, either through excessive demands, disproportionate penalties, or unbalanced rights and obligations.",General
8,"What are the unfair trade practices under the Consumer Protection Act, 2019?","The Consumer Protection Act, 2019, prohibits various unfair trade practices, including:
False or Misleading Advertisements: Advertising goods or services with false or misleading claims.
Selling Defective or Unfit Goods: Selling goods that are defective or unfit for their intended purpose.
Excessive Pricing: Charging excessively high prices for goods or services.
Refusal to Refund or Replace: Refusing to refund money or replace defective goods as per the terms of sale or service.
Coercion: Using coercion, undue influence, or pressure to compel consumers to purchase goods or services.

9,What is a misleading advertisement ?,"A misleading advertisement, concerning any product or service, is one that:
Falsely describes the product or service,
Provides false guarantees or is likely to mislead consumers regarding its nature, substance, quantity, or quality,

However, this term does not encompass a seller who offers goods or services for sale on a marketplace operated by an e-commerce entity.",General
12,What is product liability?,"Product liability refers to the responsibility of a product manufacturer or seller to compensate a consumer for any harm caused by a defective product or deficiency in services related to the product. This means that if a product is faulty or does not meet the expected standards, and this results in harm to a consumer, the manufacturer or seller is liable to provide compensation. Product liability ensures that consumers are protected from unsafe or substandard products and have recourse if they suffer harm as a result of using them.",General
13, What is product liability action?,"A ""product liability action"" refers to a complaint lodged by an individual before a District Commission, State Commission, or National Commission, seeking compensation for harm suffered. To initiate such action, the consumer must demonstrate that the harm resulted from a ""defective product or service"" purchased by them.",General
14,"What is harm under the Consumer Protection Act, 2019?","Harm in the context of product liability includes:
Damage to Property: This refers to any damage caused to property other than the product itself. For example, if a faulty electronic device causes a fire that damages a house, this would be considered harm.
Personal Injury, Illness, or Death: Harm also includes any personal injury, illness, or death caused by a defective product. For instance, if a toy contains hazardous materials that harm a child, this would be considered harm.

They operate at three levels: District, State, and National, known respectively as District Commission, State Commission, and National Commission.",General
17,What is CCPA?,"CCPA stands for the Central Consumer Protection Authority. It is an institution established by the Central Government under the provisions of the Consumer Protection Act to regulate various aspects related to consumer rights and protection. The CCPA has been granted powers to:
Regulate Matters: The CCPA regulates matters pertaining to the violation of consumer rights, unfair trade practices, and false or misleading advertisements that are detrimental to the interests of the public and consumers.

18,Can a person buying goods or services for a business purpose make a complaint ?," Under the Consumer Protection Act of 2019, individuals purchasing goods or services for business purposes cannot file complaints unless they are buying goods or using services solely for the purpose of self-employment for their livelihood. 
Any goods purchased in the course of business on behalf of their employer or company in which they have an interest, would not be covered under consumer protection. Similarly, any goods or services purchased in pursuit of a principal client relationship on behalf of a business would also not be covered by consumer protection. For example, if a person buys 10 laptops from a manufacturer on behalf of his company or place of work, that would be buying goods for a business purpose. Any issue arising out of this purchase will not be covered under the Consumer Protection Act, 2019.
However, if the goods or services are purchased in the course of self-employment for pursuit of livelihood, consumer protection law will apply to the goods and/or services purchased. For example, a self-employed carpenter purchasing a drill for his work would be able to make use of consumer protection law with respect to his purchase of the drill.",General
19,Can someone availing of public services make a complaint against the government under Consumer Protection Act?,"When the government provides services as a public authority, such as delivering public services to all citizens, no claims can be made under consumer protection law. This is because the government is not considered a seller or service provider in these cases. For example, a person cannot use consumer protection laws to address issues like delayed Income Tax refunds or dissatisfaction with the work of a municipal authority.
However, if services or goods are provided by a government-owned entity and a fee is paid for these services or goods, then consumer protection laws can apply. In such cases, the government-owned entity acts as a seller or service provider. For example, if someone has paid for services like railway tickets or purchased goods from a government-run shop, they can file a complaint under consumer protection law for any deficiencies or issues with the service or goods provided.",General
20,Can I claim compensation if the product itself is damaged?,"No, compensation cannot be claimed solely for damage to the product itself under product liability.",General
21,Who can be liable in a product liability action?,"You can file a product liability claim against various parties involved in the supply chain, including:
Manufacturer: The entity responsible for producing the product.

The seller altered or modified the product, and such alteration or modification was a substantial factor in causing harm.
 The seller provided an express warranty for the product independent of any warranty made by the manufacturer, and the product failed to meet the seller's warranty, resulting in harm.

Component of End Product: The product was sold as a component of an end product, and necessary warnings or instructions were provided by the manufacturer, but the harm was caused by the end product's use.
Expert Supervision: The product was legally meant to be used or dispensed only by or under the supervision of an expert, and the manufacturer provided reasonable warnings or instructions to such expert or class of experts.

27, Under what conditions is a “marketplace” responsible for product liability?,"A ""marketplace"" is generally not responsible for product liability issues if it merely offers a platform for buying and selling products. However, according to the CPA 2019, a marketplace may be liable in a product liability claim if it provides extra services or functions as a product manufacturer or service provider. Examples include situations where the marketplace:
a) Offers its own separate warranty for a product,
b) Provides additional services, such as installation, for a product.",General
28,Who is responsible if several parties are involved in the manufacturing of a product?,"In cases involving multiple manufacturers, liability is determined by the commission on a case-by-case basis. Factors considered include which component caused the defect and whether proper instructions or warnings were provided.

However, endorsers exercising due diligence to verify the advertisement's claims regarding the endorsed product or service are not liable to penalties.",General
31,"Before resorting to litigation, is there any process that can be pursued in order to claim compensation?","Yes, before resorting to litigation, an aggrieved individual can take the following steps to claim compensation:
Send a Notice: The individual can send a formal notice to the service provider or seller. This notice should detail:
The defects in the goods or services or the deficiencies in the service

32,Can I be asked to waive the claim under the Act?,"Waiving a claim under the Consumer Protection Act, 2019 (CPA 2019), may be deemed unfair as per the broad definition of unfair contracts outlined in the Act. Additionally, agreements that restrict legal proceedings, such as those preventing parties from enforcing their rights or limiting the time to do so, are void under the Indian Contract Act, 1872, and thus unenforceable. While the issue of waiving claims has not been tested in court, contractual language regarding such waivers should be carefully examined to avoid potential unenforceability under both the CPA 2019 and Indian contract law.",General

Government programmes like Digital India and the Bharat Net Program seek to increase internet access in rural regions so that more people can utilise e-banking.

318,What are the landmark judgements in this sector?,"Dinesh B. Patel v. State of Gujarat
The dispute arose from the sale of medicines by M/s. Denis Chemical Lab. Ltd., which were later found to contain fungus. The legal issue focused on whether the manufacturer could be held liable under Section 34 of the relevant act, which holds the entire company and associated individuals responsible for offenses committed by the company. The court, considering the severity of the allegations and the direct impact on public health, opted not to take a strictly technical view based solely on the complaints pleadings. The court rejected the argument that specific averments about the active role of directors, as required in other legal contexts, should apply in this case. Emphasizing the unique language of Section 342 of the Act and the gravity of offenses affecting public health, the court upheld the High Courts order. The directors were granted the opportunity to demonstrate to the Trial Court that they were not involved in the manufacturing process and, therefore, should not be held liable under Section 342 of the Act. The appeal was dismissed with these observations.
Common Cause v. Drug Controller of India and Others
In the case of Common Cause v. Drug Controller of India and Others 1991, a complaint was made to the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission under Section 21f of the Consumer Protection Act defective goods of the lack of adequate quality control in the manufacturing and bottling of intravenous fluids given to patients, leading to defects in the fluids. In this case, the defect was the presence of fungus due to the poor quality of the fluid itself and the inadequate cleaning and sealing of the bottle containing it. The Drug Controller was ordered by the Commission to constitute an expert committee to review the provisions of the existing legislation regulating quality control and make recommendations. The Committee made certain
recommendations for protecting the public against the possibility of contamination of I. V. fluids. This case reiterates the fact that the rational drug policy must be accompanied by sustained campaign to enhance awareness of consumers. The literate and enlightened consumers have a greater role and responsibility for materialising the above objective as they can amplify the process of educating and enlightening the illiterate and ignorant consumers.",Drugs and Cosmetics sector

320,What is generic medicine?,"According to WHO, A generic drug is a pharmaceutical product, usually intended to be interchangeable with an innovator product that is manufactured without a license from the innovator company and marketed after the expiry date of the patent or other exclusive rights . A generic drug is identical -- or bioequivalent -- to a brand name drug in dosage form, safety, strength, route of administration, quality, performance characteristics and intended use. Although generic drugs are chemically identical to their branded counterparts, they are typically sold at substantial discounts from the branded price.",Drugs and Cosmetics sector
321,What is theDrug development process for generic drugs?,"Whenever a new potential pharmaceutical product is identified, the inventor individual or company files for protection of their intellectual property. This pharmaceutical product is now patent protected and no one can produce it without permission or license from a patent holder. Patents are transferable following a legal process involving payment of royalty. Innovator Company is the first one to identify or develop and market the pharmaceutical product. Once the duration of patent protection expires usually 20 years unless specified, the product can be
manufactured and marketed by anyone without permission from the innovator provided it shows bioequivalence with the innovators product. These products are called generics and manufacturers are called generic manufacturers while those from innovator companies are called branded.",Drugs and Cosmetics sector
322,What are branded generics?,"Once the patent period of a drug is over, any company can manufacture and market the drug without the permission of the innovator company , as long as it shows bioequivalence, that is, prove to the drug regulator that the copy releases the same amount of the active ingredient and is absorbed by the body in the same way as the original or innovator drug. Such a proven copy of a drug is called its generic version.",Drugs and Cosmetics sector
323,What is the difference between branded generics and generic generics?,"The difference is in the name. One is sold under a brand name and the other is sold under a generic name. But both are generic drugs, that are their patent has expired. Generic drugs are sold by the non-proprietary name or generic name instead of a brand name. The international non-proprietory name INN is a unique name given to identify pharmaceutical substances or active pharmaceutical ingredients. INN is globally recognised and is public property unlike a brand name that belongs to a particular company. A nonproprietary name, also known as generic name, is the simplified name for a chemical product. Since it is impossible to remember the chemical name for most people, the INN for this is pioglitazone. So, this chemical can be sold by its INN or generic name, as pioglitazone, or it can be given a brand name Pioglar from Ranbaxy , Pioz by USV , Pioped by Torrent and sold as a branded generic.",Drugs and Cosmetics sector
324,Why are generic prescriptions preferred?,"Companies spend huge amounts of money on promoting their branded generics and that cost is added to the drugs price, making them much more costly than generic named drugs. To bring down the cost of prescription drugs, most health systems opt for generic named drugs and ensure that the quality of generic drugs are maintained. Only generic names are used in medical and pharmacological textbooks. It is expected that the use of generic names will ensure production, sale, and dispensing of more rational, single ingredient drugs.",Drugs and Cosmetics sector
325,Why do doctors in India object to prescription using generic names?,"Doctors are often influenced by the marketing practices of pharmaceutical companies and believe that drugs being sold under trade names are of better quality. There are also genuine concerns about the quality of many of the branded generic drugs and the generic name drugs. With very high margins for retailers on generic drugs, both branded as well as generic name drugs, doctors fear that their generic prescriptions will be used by pharmacists to push the products of companies that give them the highest margins. Doctors fear that while they are directly held responsible to the patient for treatment, the pharmacists would not be held liable for dispensing poor quality drugs.",Drugs and Cosmetics sector
326,What is the status of generic prescriptions in developed countries?,"Since the economic crisis of 2008, most developed nations have taken several measures to push the prescription of generic drugs. In 2013, generics accounted for more than three-quarters of the volume of pharmaceuticals sold in the US, UK, Chile, Germany and New Zealand. Generics accounted for well over one quarter of the market in Italy , France and Japan. Prescribing in INN is permitted in two thirds of OECD countries and mandatory in France, Spain, Portugal and Estonia. Many developed countries have also fixed price caps for generic drugs, either by bulk procurement through tenders or by fixing it as a certain percentage of the brand-names price.",Drugs and Cosmetics sector
327,Are generic drugs as effective as brand-name drugs?,"Yes. A generic drug is the same as a brand-name drug in dosage, safety, strength, quality, the way it works, the way it is taken and the way it should be used.
Not every brand-name drug has a generic drug. When new drugs are first made they have drug patents. Most drug patents are protected for 20 years. The patent, which protects the company that made the drug first, doesnt allow anyone else to make and sell the drug. When the patent expires, other drug companies can start selling a generic version of the drug. But, first, they must test the drug and the concerned authority must approve it.
Creating a drug costs lots of money. Since generic drug makers do not develop a drug from scratch, the costs to bring the drug to market are less therefore, generic drugs are usually less
expensive than brand-name drugs. But, generic drug makers must show that their product performs in the same way as the brand-name drug",Drugs and Cosmetics sector
328,What standards do generic drugs have to meet to be available for public consumption?,"Before marketing the drug, generic manufacturers need to obtain permission from relevant drug regulatory authorities.
First, any drug manufactured should follow good manufacturing practices guidelines, the enforcement of which is the responsibility of drug regulators. The manufacturing units should obtain certification in this regard from drug regulators of the respective Country.
Second, there is a requirement for in-vitro dissolution and in-vivo bio-availability and bio-equivalence BA-BE testing of new brand from generic manufacturer which compares the release of active pharmaceutical ingredient API on certain dissolution and liberation characteristics and pharmacokinetic parameters Cmax, Tmax, and area-under-the-curve with those from reference standard. If dissolution and BA-BE of API is within acceptable range only then, the new brand is approved for marketing. This ensures that the quality of drugs marketed by generic manufacturers is as good as the one marketed by the innovators. In-vivo BA-BE studies are required only at the time of seeking approval for marketing and not after that while in-vitro studies can be performed anytime.
Health professionals and consumers can be assured that approved generic drugs have met the same rigid standards as the innovator drug.
contain the same active ingredients as the innovator druginactive ingredients may vary
be identical in strength, dosage form, and route of administration

329,How are Generics similar to Brand-Name Drugs?,"The law requires a generic drug to meet standards that ensure its the same basic product as the brand-name drug. That means the generic drug is safe and can be taken:
The same way as a brand-name drug
For the same reason as a brand-name drug
To approve a generic drug, it must be the same as the brand-name product in:
 Active ingredient
 Strength
 Use and effect
 How you take it for example as a pill, inhaler, or liquid
 Ability to reach the required level in the bloodstream at the right time and to the same extent
 Testing standards",Drugs and Cosmetics sector
330,How Are Generics Different From Brand-Name Drugs?,"Some differences between generics and brand-name drugs are allowed. These may change the look of the drug. But they dont affect how it works or its safety.
Generic drugs may differ in:
Shape
Color
Packaging
Labeling minor differences
Generic drugs are allowed to have different inactive ingredients than brand-name drugs. For example, they may have a different:
Flavoring
Preservative
The inactive ingredients in a generic, though, must be considered safe by the approving authority.
Generic drugs may also have a different expiration date than brand-name drugs. But even so, the generic must keep its effectiveness until its expiration date, just like a brand-name product.",Drugs and Cosmetics sector
331,Why Are Generic Drugs Cheaper Than Brand-Name Drugs?,"You may be wondering how a generic drug can be sold at a much lower price than a brand-name drug.
The difference in price has to do with the different costs drug makers have in bringing generics and brand-name drugs to the pharmacy shelf.",Drugs and Cosmetics sector
332,Are There Situations That Require Special Consideration Before Choosing a Generic?,"Some drugs -- known as NTI narrow therapeutic index drugs -- may need special consideration if you are thinking of using the generic version. NTI drugs have a narrow margin between the amount that is safe and effective and the amount that is toxic.
These generic drugs include:
warfarin a blood thinner
digoxin treats certain heart conditions
theophylline treats asthma, COPD, and other lung diseases
Your doctor should tell you if you are taking an NTI drug and what type of monitoring you need.",Drugs and Cosmetics sector
333,Should I Be Taking Generic Medication?,"Generics are not available for all medications. The best way to find out if a generic is available for a medication you are taking -- and whether or not you should take it -- is to ask your doctor and pharmacist.
Some health insurance providers require you to use a generic drug, if available. If you choose to purchase the brand-name product, you may end up paying on your own or have a larger co-pay.
Generally, your pharmacist can substitute a generic drug for a brand-name drug. If a generic is available, but for some reason your doctor thinks you should still take the brand-name drug, hell write Do Not Substitute on the prescription.
If your pharmacist for some reason does not substitute a generic for a brand-name drug, you can ask your doctor to indicate on the prescription that substitutions are acceptable. That way, you can get the same drug for a lot less money.
It can get confusing. Dont be afraid to ask your pharmacist if the medication you received is the generic form of the medicine you are used to taking.
Tell your doctor if you notice any change in your condition or have any unusual side effects when changing from a brand-name to a generic drug.",Drugs and Cosmetics sector
334,What are the Indian laws and policy on generic drugs?,"The regulation of manufacture, sale and distribution of drugs is primarily the concern of state authorities while central authorities are responsible for approval of new drugs and clinical trials, laying down the standards for drugs, control over the quality of imported drugs, coordination of the activities of State Drug Control Organizations providing expert advice with a view of bring about the uniformity in the enforcement of the Drugs and Cosmetics Act.

338,What are the other legislations that are present and govern the pharmaceutical practice in India?,"Drugs and Cosmetics Act of 1940 and Rules 1945
In India, drug manufacturing, quality and marketing is regulated in accordance with the Drugs and Cosmetics Act of 1940 and Rules 1945. Over the last few decades, this act has undergone several amendments. The Drugs Controller General of India DCGI, who heads the Central Drugs Standards Control Organization CDSCO, assumes responsibility for the amendments to the Acts and Rules. Other major related Acts and Rules include the Pharmacy Act of 1948, The Drugs and Magic Remedies Act of 1954 and Drug Prices Control Order DPCO 1995 and various other policies instituted by the Department of Chemicals and Petrochemicals.
Some of the important schedules of the Drugs and Cosmetic Acts include:
Schedule D: dealing with exemption in drug imports,
Schedule M: to control spurious drugs, incorporated in 1995 that lays down Good Manufacturing PracticesGMP at par with WHO standards.involving premises and plants
Schedule Y: which, specifies guidelines for clinical trials, import and manufacture of new drugs
In accordance with the Act of 1940, there exists a system of dual regulatory control or control at both Central and State government levels. The central regulatory authority undertakes approval of new drugs, clinical trials, standards setting, control over imported drugs and coordination of state bodies activities. State authorities assume responsibility for issuing licenses and monitoring manufacture, distribution and sale of drugs and other related products.
Narcotic Drugs And Psychotropic Substances Act
The Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Bill, 1985 was introduced in the Lok Sabha in August 1985 and subsequently passed by both the Houses of Parliament.It came into force on 14 November 1985 as The Narcotic Drugs And Psychotropic Substances Act, 1985 shortened to NDPS Act. Under the NDPS Act, it is illegal for a person to produce/manufacture/cultivate, possess, sell, purchase, transport, store, and/or consume any narcotic drug or psychotropic substance. Under one of the provisions of the act, the Narcotics Control Bureau was set up with effect from March 1986. The Act is designed to fulfill Indias treaty obligations under the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs, Convention on Psychotropic Substances, and United Nations Convention Against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances. The Act has been amended three times in 1988, 2001, and most recently in 2014.
Prevention of Illicit Trafficking in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act
The Prevention of Illicit Trafficking in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act is a drug control law passed in 1988 by the Parliament of India. It was established to enable the full implementation and enforcement of the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act of 1985.
The Narcotics Control Bureau NCB is the chief law enforcement and intelligence agency of India responsible for fighting drug trafficking and the abuse of illegal substances. It was created on 17 March 1986 to enable the full implementation of the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act 1985 and fight its violation through the Prevention of Illicit Trafficking in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act 1988.
There exists a published list that mentions the names of all substances banned or controlled in India under the NDPS Act 237 line items. The list uses the International Nonproprietary Name INN of the drugs but in some cases mentions drugs by their chemical name also widely known drugs such as ganja, cocaine, heroin etc. are mentioned as such. Cultivation/production/manufacture, possession, sale, purchase, transport, storage, consumption or distribution of any of the following substances, except for medical and scientific purposes and as per the rules or orders and conditions of licenses that may be issued, is illegal and a punishable offense.
The Patents Act
The Patent Act of 1970 recognized only process patents. The life of the patent was also reduced significantly from 16 to 5 years from the date of sealing or 7 years from the date of filling a complete application, whichever is shorter in other words, the maximum period of patent was 7 years. Further, in the amended Act an MNC could patent only one process.
The Patent Act of 1970 and the changes in domestic regulation virtually curbed the monopoly of MNCs. Adopting the flexible provisions of the amended patent act, indigenous companies started imitating the patented product and could eventually come out with better processes for the same product.
The industry also embarked on the path of high growth during this period. The other significant outcomes were fall in the prices of the medicines and the introduction of a large number of generic versions of patented products.
The drug policy of 1978 was, however, revised in 1986 to dilute the mechanism of check and control with respect to the production of certain categories of drugs. NDP 1986 also regularized the production of a large number of drugs that were earlier questionable on regulatory grounds.
The Patent Law was amended under the WTO compulsion to recognize product patent from 2005 onward. This was implemented in a staggered manner in three phases. The first phase of it was implemented in 1995 in which the mail-box system was recognized.
On January 1, 2000, a Second Amendment was introduced where the salient features were re-defined patentable subject matter, extended the term of patent protection to 20 years and amended the compulsory licensing system.
A third amendment of patent law was made on January 1, 2005 to introduce product patent regime in areas, including pharmaceuticals that were hitherto covered by process patents only.",Drugs and Cosmetics sector
339,How are pricing and tax policies made for drugs and pharmaceuticals? What are DPCO and NPPA and what role do they play in making policy for drugs and pharmaceuticals?,"Price control on medicines was first introduced in India in 1962 and has subsequently undergone evolution through the Drug Price Control Order DPCO. As per the directive of NPPA, the criterion for price regulation is based on the nature of the drug in terms of whether it enjoys mass consumption and in terms of whether there is lack of adequate competition for the drug.
In 1978 selective price controls based on disease burden and prevalence was brought about by the Government. Thereafter, the list of prices under DPCO underwent a gradual decrease over a period of time. Around 80 of the market, with 342 drugs, was under price control in 1979. The number of drugs under DPCO decreased from 142 drugs in 1987 to 74 in 1995.
The major objective of DPCO 1995 was to decrease monopoly in any given market segment, further decrease the number of drugs under price control to 74 and the inclusion of products manufactured by small scale producers under price control list.
In 1997, the National Pharmaceutical Pricing Authority NPPA was constituted in order to administer DPCO and deal with issues related to price revision.
The NPPA also regulates the prices of bulk drugs or pharmaceutical actives. The MRP excise on medicines was levied by the Finance ministry in 2005 with the objective of increasing revenue and lowering prices of medicines by using fiscal deterrent on MRP. This change may have had some impact in terms of magnifying the advantage to industries located in the excise free zones.
Drugs with high sales and a market share of more than 50 are part of the price regulation exercise. These drugs are referred to as scheduled drugs. Historically the NPPA would intervene only if the annual price increases were more than 20.
However, post-2007, the NPPA intervenes in cases where drugs have significant sales and where the annual price increases by 10.
The National Pharmaceuticals Policy 2006, proposed various measures such as increasing the number of bulk drugs under regulation from 74 to 354, regulating trade margins and instituting a new framework for drug price negotiations so as to make drugs more affordable for the Indian masses, to name a few.",Drugs and Cosmetics sector
340,Good Manufacturing Practices and policies,"World Health Organization GMP guidelines were instituted in 1975 in order to assist regulatory authorities in different countries to ensure consistency in quality, safety and efficacy standards while importing and exporting drugs and related products. India is one of the signatories to the certification scheme.
The WHO-GMP certification, which possesses two-year validity, may be granted both by CDSCO and state regulatory authorities after a thorough inspection of the manufacturing premises.
WHO defines Good manufacturing practice GMP as a system for ensuring that products are consistently produced and controlled according to quality standards. It is designed to minimize the risks involved in any pharmaceutical production be it manufacturing, packaging, testing, labeling, distributing and importing, that cannot be eliminated through testing the final product drug or device or any formulation. The GMP protocols are largely concerned with parameters such as drug quality, safety, efficacy and potency.
India has made progress in the domain of GMP through the enforcement of Schedule M Compliance. The requirements specified under the upgraded Schedule M for GMP have become mandatory for pharmaceutical units in India from July 1, 2005. Schedule M classifies the various statutory requirements mandatory for drugs, medical devices and other categories of products as per the current Good Manufacturing Practices cGMP. Schedule M contains various regulations for manufacturing, premises, waste disposal, and equipment.
Schedule M protocols have been revised to harmonize it along the lines of WHO and US-FDA protocols. These revised protocols include detailed specifications on infrastructure and premises, environmental safety and health measures, production and operation controls, quality control and assurance and stability and validation studies.
Schedule M compliance is the next thing, smaller pharmaceutical units may take longer to be compliant whereas large-scale firms have shown greater willingness to comply with the revised norms in order to increase their competitiveness in the global arena. According to state regulatory sources, units in states like Gujarat, Karnataka, Maharashtra and Andhra Pradesh have achieved a high percentage of Schedule M compliance in comparison to units in other states.
Export of drugs, devices, and formulations to developed countries from India requires that Regulators from these countries visit Indian manufacturers to carry out a thorough inspection of their manufacturing units before registering the concerned product.
A large number of domestic players are seeking international regulatory approvals from agencies like US-FDA, MHRA UK, TGA Australia and MCC South Africa in order to export their products, mostly generic medicines, in these markets. Indian drug makers have the largest number of FDA-approved plants outside the US and accounted for 39 per cent of all approvals for generic drugs during 2013.
The cost of production has been a leading source of Indias industry strength, as India is 60 cheaper than the U.S. and 50 cheaper than Europe in terms of drug production costs.",Drugs and Cosmetics sector
341,What are the Policies relating to clinical trials in India?,"Till about a decade ago, there was little or no visibility with regard to the conduct of quality clinical trials in India-compliant to regulatory standards and ethics. The Central Drugs Standards Control Organization CDSCO has played a critical role in bringing about a positive change in
the clinical trials landscape for India.The progression towards Good Clinical Practice GCP has largely been a gradual and slow process.
In 1988 local clinical trials for new drug introductions were first made mandatory in India. Along with the changeover to product patents in January 2005, India also amended the schedule Y of the Drugs and Cosmetics Rules to allow drug trials without a phase lag in the country, that is, Phase II and Phase III trials were permitted only after these had been carried out elsewhere in the world.
The new rule permitted conducting the concurrent trials of the same phase in India. Also Drugs Technical Advisory Board DTAB made GLP practices mandatory for all laboratories and in-house units of pharmaceutical firms and Contract Research Organizations CROs.
Reports of incidents of ethical violations related to informed consent and conduct of trials by multinational and domestic organizations were known prior to the year 2000. In 2000, the regulators the Central Ethics Committee on Human Research CECHR and Indian Council of Medical Research ICMR took proactive initiative to conceptualize and issue the Ethical Guidelines for Biomedical Research on Human Subjects.
The Good Clinical Practice GCP guidelines were developed in line with the latest WHO and ICH guidelines in 2001 by Central Expert Committee -set up for the purpose by Central Drugs Standards Control Organization CDSCO
Subsequently in 2005, the requirements of data submission on animal testing for permission to undertake Phase I, Phase II and Phase III clinical trials were laid down in the revised Schedule Y of the Drugs and Cosmetics rules.
Clear responsibilities for investigators and sponsors were specified and notifying changes in the protocol were made mandatory. Expert clinicians  scientists from the industry assist the evaluation of the relevant data submitted to the Drugs Control General of India DCGI
Similarly, for registration and approval of new drugs, which have already been registered and used in the country of origin, The DCGI mandates Phase II trials in about 100 prior to allowing such products to be marketed in India. Normally, new drug approval is usually granted for a period of about two years. The trials are conducted only after clearances are obtained from the Institutional Ethics Committees. Consent of patients for participation in such trials is an integral part of the regulatory framework.
However, there remains a need for the establishment of pharmacovigilance centers at national, zonal and regional levels to monitor adverse drug reactions to be met.",Drugs and Cosmetics sector
342,What are the policies and guidelines on medical devices and biotechnology in India?,"Medical devices
In June 2007, the DCGI introduced a new set of guidelines for the import and manufacture of medical devices in the country.
The Mashelkar Committee subsequently recommended the creation of a specific medical devices division within the CDSCO in order to address the management, approval, certification and quality assurance of all medical devices.
This essentially consisted in alteration of the status of sterile medical devices, intended for internal or external use to medical drugs and creation of suitable provisions and amendments to the Drugs and Cosmetics Act of 1940.
The Drugs Consultative Committee approved these recommendations in 2005, ensuring that in future all devices would be licensed for manufacture, distributed and sold by the CDSCO, with special evaluation committees in order to ensure that the concerned manufacturing units complied with the requisite GMP requirements.",Drugs and Cosmetics sector

422,What are the landmark judgements in this sector?,"The issue of whether consumer courts have jurisdiction over educational institutions remains a complex matter, marked by conflicting judgments from different benches of the Supreme Court. 

Manu Solanki v. Vinayaka Mission University.  
In an attempt to settle this dispute, a three-judge bench in 2020, comprising Dr. D.Y. Chandrachud, Indu Malhotra, and Indira Banerjee, JJ., acknowledged the divergence of views within the Court on whether educational institutions fall under the Consumer Protection Act, 1986. The bench deemed it necessary to admit the case for further consideration, stating that the appeal required admission due to conflicting opinions.
P. Sreenivasulu v. P.J. Alexander.  
Affirming consumer court jurisdiction, the Supreme Court allowed civil appeals filed by students in the case of P. Sreenivasulu v. P.J. Alexander. The court referred to the precedent set by the Buddhist Mission Dental College  Hospital v. Bhupesh Khurana, which established that the provision of education for a fee falls within the definition of service in the Consumer Protection Act.  According to this perspective, students paying fees for educational services are considered consumers, and the Act is applicable.
Bihar School Examination Board v. Suresh Prasad Sinha.  
Rejecting consumer court jurisdiction, the Supreme Court ruled in the case of Bihar School Examination Board v. Suresh Prasad Sinha that disputes related to faults in conducting examinations and non-declaration of results by examinees do not fall within the ambit of the Consumer Protection Act, 1986. The court argued that the examination process is a statutory function and not a service provided for consideration.
To reconcile this conflict, it is crucial to consider the specific circumstances of cases where the Supreme Court acknowledged consumer court jurisdiction. Notably, instances involved deficiencies in services by educational institutions, such as a Dental College admitting students without proper affiliation or recognition by relevant authorities. Since these institutions were not recognized as educational institutions under the statutory rules, that is perhaps why the court stated it had jurisdiction.",Education Sector

In the case of Idea Cellular Ltd. v. Angad Kumar, the petitioner, Idea Cellular, launched a scheme called Tyoharan Ki Saugat for eligible subscribers in a specific period. The respondent, Angad Kumar, received a message claiming that he had won an Alto Car in the scheme. When he approached the petitioners office for the car, it was not provided. The petitioner contended that a revised message was sent, asking to ignore the earlier message and that the number was not registered in Angad Kumars name.
The District Forum ruled in favor of the respondent, directing the petitioner to pay for the Alto car, compensation, and litigation costs. The State Commission upheld the order with a modification in the compensation amount. The National Commission, in its decision, observed that the petitioners negligence in handling the communication caused harassment and mental trauma to the respondent.

The petitioner was directed to pay this amount within 45 days, and in case of non-compliance, an interest of 10 p.a. would be applicable.

The complainant sought compensation of Rs. 99,95,500/- for the alleged deficiencies in service. The respondents contended that the connection was not activated due to the complainants non-residence at the given address.
The State Commission observed deficiencies in service and unfair trade practices by the respondents but dismissed the complaint, considering the claimed amount disproportionate. The State Commission directed the complainant to pay Rs. 10,000/- to the State Consumer Welfare Fund within 30 days otherwise, it would carry an interest of 9 p.a.

General Manager, Telecom v. M. Krishnan and Another
In the case of General Manager, Telecom v. M. Krishnan and Another, a Special Appeal was filed with the Supreme Court. The dispute revolved around the non-payment of a telephone bill, leading to the disconnection of the telephone connection provided to the first respondent. Dissatisfied with the disconnection, the first respondent filed a complaint before the District Consumer Disputes Redressal Forum, Kozhikode. The Consumer Forum ruled in favor of the first respondent, directing the appellant General Manager, Telecom to re-connect the telephone and pay compensation.
The appellant challenged the jurisdiction of the consumer forum by filing a writ petition before the Kerala High Court, but it was dismissed. The Writ Appeal was also dismissed by a Full Bench of the Kerala High Court. The Supreme Court, in its decision, held that when a special remedy is provided under Section 7-B of the Indian Telegraph Act, 1885, specifically addressing disputes related to telephone bills, the remedy under the Consumer Protection Act, 1986 is impliedly barred.
The Supreme Court pointed out that Rule 413 of the Telegraph Rules subjects all services related to the telephone to Telegraph Rules, and a telephone connection can be disconnected for default of payment under Rule 443 of the Rules. The court emphasized that the special law, the Telegraph Act, would prevail over the general law, the Consumer Protection Act. It referred to a previous decision stating that the National Commission lacks jurisdiction to adjudicate claims for compensation arising from motor vehicle accidents.
As a result, the Supreme Court allowed the appeal, setting aside the order and judgment of the High Court.

488,What is a misleading advertisement?,"Any advertisement or promotion through Television, Radio, or any other electronic media, Newspapers, Banners, Posters, Handbills, wall-writing etc. to misrepresent the nature, characteristics, qualities or geographic origin of goods, services or commercial activities so as to mislead the consumer could be broadly defined as a misleading advertisement.",Entertainment and Media
489,When does an Advertisement become Misleading?,"When an edible oil advertisement gives you the impression that you are free of heart problems so long as you are using that particular oil, then it is misrepresenting facts. When an advertisement of a water purifier that filters only bacteria and not viruses claims that it gives 100 percent safe water, then it is a false statement. When a cell phone service provider promises STD calls for 40 paise per minute, but omits to say that this rate is applicable only when calls are made to numbers serviced by the same provider, then it constitutes misrepresentation. When a manufacturer claims that the refrigerator marketed by him is the best or that it keeps the food inside germ-free, that claim should be backed by adequate data to substantiate the claim. Or else, it becomes a false statement. When an advertisement for a detergent says that it can remove grease in just one wash- it should be able to do just that and the manufacturer should be able to prove this. Or else, it is an incorrect statement or a false advertisement. When an advertisement promises to give you a free gift every time you buy the advertised product, the free gift should really be so. If the manufacturer is recovering either fully or even partly, the cost of the so-called free gift, then the advertisement becomes false and misleading. If a retailer claims that he is offering a special discount on his goods as part of a festival celebration, while he is actually using the festival as an excuse to get rid of old and outdated goods, then he is deceiving consumers. When a toothpaste advertisement says that it prevents cavities, one expects the manufacturer to have the data to prove this. If he fails to do that, then he is making an unsubstantiated claim or a false statement. If an advertisement for a face cream claims that it removes dark spots on the face and even prevents them from coming back, the manufacturer should be able to prove this. Or else, it is a deceptive advertisement. Even reducing crucial information about the product to minute letters at the bottom of the advertisement could be termed as an unfair trade practice, particularly if such information is not intelligible to the consumer.",Entertainment and Media

While specific procedures may vary among service providers, here is a generalized outline of a complaint redressal system for the home service sector:

	Customer Contact - Customers can initiate the complaint redressal process by contacting the service provider through designated channels such as customer service helplines, email, mobile applications, or online complaint forms.

	Complaint Registration - Customers need to provide detailed information about their complaint, including specifics such as the service availed, date and time, service provider details, and a clear description of the issue.

	Acknowledgment of Complaint - The service provider acknowledges the receipt of the complaint, either through an automated response or direct communication, confirming that the complaint is being investigated.

	Investigation and Resolution - The service provider initiates an investigation into the complaint, examining relevant service records, conducting interviews, or even arranging for on-site inspections if necessary. The goal is to identify the root cause and determine an appropriate resolution.

	Resolution Communication - Once the investigation is complete, the service provider communicates the resolution to the customer. This communication includes details about the actions taken to address the complaint and any compensation or corrective measures implemented.

	Feedback and Follow-Up - Service providers often seek feedback from customers regarding the resolution process to assess customer satisfaction. Follow-up communications ensure that the issue has been fully resolved and that the customer is content with the outcome.

	Escalation Mechanism - In cases where the customer is dissatisfied with the resolution or believes that the complaint has not been adequately addressed, there may be an escalation mechanism. This could involve contacting a higher-level customer service representative or a dedicated complaints department.

	Consumer Forums and Regulatory Authorities - If the complaint remains unresolved or the customer is not satisfied with the resolution provided by the service provider, regulatory authorities and consumer forums may be contacted. These entities may offer additional avenues for dispute resolution and may have established grievance redressal mechanisms.

	Ombudsman Services - Some sectors have established ombudsman services that act as an independent authority to review and resolve complaints if the customer is not satisfied with the resolution provided by the service provider.
	Consumer Protection Agencies - If the issue persists after engaging with the retailer, consumers can file a complaint with local consumer protection agencies or consumer affairs departments. These agencies typically have specific procedures for filing complaints and can offer guidance on consumer rights. They act as intermediaries to address disputes between consumers and retailers.

	Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission CDRC - Established under the Consumer Protection Act of 1986, the CDRC operates at the District, State, and National levels. Consumers can file complaints related to unfair trade practices, defective goods or services, overcharging, hazardous products, and misleading advertising.

554,What is medical negligence?,"Recently, there has been a rise in patient rights awareness in Indian culture. Currently, common law principles relating to negligence, tainted consent, and violation of confidentiality are taken into account during the adjudication process for medical professional liability, whether it be in a consumer forum or a regular civil or criminal court. When a patient seeks medical advice from him, the practitioner owes them certain obligations. Negligence is the result of a failure to perform this responsibility. Negligence means carelessness or a lack of proper care and attention. To constitute negligence three elements must be fulfilled:-
 Firstly there must be duty to take care on the part of the opposite party towards the complainant.
 There must be a breach of that duty.
 Damage or injury by the complainant as a result of such breach.

Apart from protection from negligence, patients also have certain rights:
 Patients have the right to be told about their illness, and to have their medical records explained.
 Patients should be explained about whatever treatment/medicines are prescribed to them. They should be made aware of the risks and side effects, if any. They have the right to ask questions and clarify their doubts about the treatment. 
 Patients have the right to maintain confidentiality regarding their illness and can expect the same from the doctors.
 Patients have the right to a second opinion if they are doubtful about the medicines or treatment suggested.
 Patients have the right to know what a suggested operation/surgery is for, and the possible risks involved. If he/she is unconscious or unable to make the decision due to other reasons, informed consent needs to be taken from their nearest relatives.

 For business and industry
o Easy compliance 
o Uniformity of tax rates and structures
o Removal of cascading
o Improved competitiveness
o Gain to manufacturers and exporters
 For Central and State Governments :
o Simple and easy to administer
o Better controls on leakage
o Higher revenue efficiency
 For Consumers :
o Single and transparent tax proportionate to the value of goods and services: Due to multiple indirect taxes being levied by the Centre and State, with incomplete or no input tax credits available at progressive stages of value addition, the cost of most goods and services in the country today are laden with many hidden taxes. Under GST, there would be only one tax from the manufacturer to the consumer, leading to transparency of taxes paid to the final consumer.
 Relief in overall tax burden: Because of efficiency gains and prevention of leakages, the overall tax burden on most commodities will come down, which will benefit consumers.",Other Sectors
601,How will GST benefit the common consumers?,"As already mentioned earlier, with the introduction of GST, all the cascading effects of CENVAT and service tax will be more comprehensively removed with a continuous chain of set-off from the producers point to the retailers point than what was not possible under the prevailing CENVAT and VAT regime.

Centre would levy and collect Central Goods and Services Tax CGST, and States would levy and collect the State Goods and Services Tax SGST on all transactions within a State. The input tax credit of CGST would be available for discharging the CGST liability on the output at each stage. Similarly, the credit of SGST paid on inputs would be allowed for paying the SGST on output. No cross utilization of credit would be permitted.",Other Sectors
608,What are the benefits which the Country will take you from GST?,"Introduction of GST would be a very significant step in the field of indirect tax reforms in India. By amalgamating a large number of Central and State taxes into a single tax and allowing set -off prior-stage taxes, it would mitigate the ill effects of cascading of taxes and pave the way for a common national market. For the consumers, the biggest game would be in terms of a reduction in the overall tax burden on goods, which is currently estimated at 25 -30. Introduction of GST would also take our products competitive in the domestic and international markets. Studies show that this would instantly spur economic growth. There may also be revenue gain for the Centre and the States due to widening of the tax base, increase in trade volumes and improved tax compliance.

https://dot.gov.in/public-grievances
i Reaching out to the service provider:
The main responsibility to address the concern of consumers relating to poor connection, redressal, and connection services rests with the service providers based on the licensing terms and conditions.
The TRAI came up with a two-tier grievance redressal mechanism that shall be set up by all the Telecom Service Providers. This two-tier mechanism is constituted in the following manner-
a. A Complaint Centre with a toll-free Consumer Care Number which will be responsible to address all the complaints received by them. The procedure for dealing with these complaints is that a unique docket number is given to every complaint, which is stored for a period of three years. This docket number, alongside the date and time of registration, and the time limit for resolution of complaints shall be communicated to the consumer through SMS. The time limit for resolving service disruption difficulties is within a period of 3 days, and all other queries within a maximum of 7 days.
In case the consumer is not satisfied with the complaint redressal at the Call Centre level, they can reach out to the Nodal Officer of the Service Provider. The problems relating to disruption of service shall be redressed within 3 days, and all other cases shall be dealt with within 10 days.
b. An Appellate Authority constituted of one or more persons to deal with grievances, that could be reached if a consumer is not satisfied with the redressal of his complaint, or his complaint remains unaddressed or no intimation of redressal of the complaint is received within the specified period. This body is called the Telecom Dispute Settlement and Appellate Authority TDSAT. The time limit for filing an appeal in TDSAT is within three months from the disposal of complaints by the Nodal Officer. However, it remains at the discretion of the appellate authority to admit complaints beyond that period.
The tribunal also directs parties to go for mediation, which ensures cost and time saving for the parties involved. In any case, if the dispute is not resolved through mediation, the consumer can reapproach the tribunal through an advocate. The proceedings in the TDSAT are the same as in a court.
Moreover, the time limit for disposal of the appeal is within three months from the date of filing of the appeal.
Furthermore, the TRAI has also set provisions for rent rebates to consumers in cases of delay in the resolution of complaints. This is as follows-
a For more than 3 days and up to 7 days- rent rebate for 7 days
b For more than 7 days and up to 15 days- rent rebate for 15 days
c For more than 15 days- rent rebate for one month
ii Approaching any other appropriate judicial or quasi-judicial body:
The complainant is free to take the service provider to a court or any other suitable venue judicial or quasi-judicial. The proceedings in consumer commissions are not mired by the niceties of procedure, allowing the complainant to file a complaint for himself. As a consumer, the aggrieved party can take the service provider to the appropriate consumer commission, based on the pecuniary and territorial jurisdiction. The jurisdictions of the various consumer commissions are as follows-
a District Commission: The aggrieved consumer can reach out to the District Commission under section 34 of the CPA, 2019, which provides that the district commission shall entertain matters where the value of the goods or services paid as consideration does not exceed more than one crore rupees.
b State Commission: In cases where the value of the goods or services paid as consideration is more than one crore, but less than 10 crores, the consumer can approach the State Commission. Moreover, in cases of unfair contracts, the State Commission has original jurisdiction and the consumer can be directly approached. An appeal against the order of the District Commission can also be made under section 47 of the CPA, 2019.
c National Commission: The National Commission can entertain matters where the value of goods or services paid as consideration exceeds 10 crores. Section 58 also provides that complaints against unfair contracts can be entertained by NCDRC when the amount of value paid exceeds 10 crores. The NCDRC also has appellate jurisdiction against the orders of any State Commission and Central Authority.
Moreover, it must also be kept in mind that section 100 of the CPA, 2019 provides that the remedy under CPA is in addition and not in derogation of other available remedies.
Another remedy available to consumers is mediation. Chapter 5 of the Consumer Protection Act provides for establishing mediation cells and resolving consumer complaints using mediation.The following link could be used to file complaints online:

The consumer can complain to the District Collector of the respective district for investigation and subsequent proceedings by the CCPA. He/she/they can also submit a complaint via email, at com-ccpanic.in. ",Telecommunications Sector

These include situations where the consumer is unable to file an appeal against an order within a period of three months, where the complaint is based on a frivolous cause of action, where the complaint falls outside the jurisdiction of the authority approached, and when the complaint has been filed under wrong sections of the act, and other such situations.",Telecommunications Sector
824,Is there a national body for handling this consumer area? What body handles this area for India?,"The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India Act, 1997 establishes the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India TRAI, which is the regulatory body for the telecom sector in India.

An appeal against the order of the District Commission can also be made under section 47 of the CPA, 2019.
c National Commission: The National Commission can entertain matters where the value of goods or services paid as consideration exceeds 10 crores. Section 58 also provides that complaints against unfair contracts can be entertained by NCDRC when the amount of value paid exceeds 10 crores. The NCDRC also has appellate jurisdiction against the orders of any State Commission and Central Authority.
Moreover, it must also be kept in mind, that section 100 of the CPA, 2019 provides that the remedy under CPA is in addition and not in derogation of other available remedies.
